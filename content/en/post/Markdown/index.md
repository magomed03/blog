## What is Markdown

Markdown is a text markup language for documents. It was invented in 2004 by blogger John Gruber and Internet activist Aaron Schwartz to quickly format articles. Their language requirements were as follows:

1. The simpler the better.
2. Documents with this markup can be translated into a beautifully formatted view, as on a web page.
3. The source text of the material should remain readable even without conversion to a web page.
4. As a result, they have a simple language that is still actively used.

The point of the markdown is that you make the markup of your document with minimal effort, and already some other plugin or program turns your markup into a final document - for example, HTML. But it is possible not in HTML, but in PDF or something else. Markdown is like a language for other programs to form documents based on your text.

The only thing you may need is to adjust fonts, margins and colors in this plugin to make the result look beautiful. You set it up once, and then you quickly write a lot of materials that will turn into ready-made articles with good markup at the output.

## How does this magic work

If we just write the text and mark it up using Markdown, then it will remain text with different special characters. To make the result look like in the screenshot above, use special editors, plugins or programs that support this markup language.

It works like this:

1. The program takes the text and looks to see if there is this markup in it.
2. If there is — applies the desired design rule to the desired text fragment and displays it beautifully. If necessary, she will substitute a picture, make a link and design the list herself.
3. If there is no markup, it outputs the content simply as text.
4. This does not work in every editor — if you highlight text with asterisks in Word, then it will remain text with asterisks, without italics or bold design. But almost all editors understand when text marked with a markdown is inserted into them. They then immediately select the necessary fragments, make headlines and insert pictures.

## Why use Markdown

There are several reasons.

1. If you need a simple text design without frills or you need to quickly prepare the material for publication without complex layout.
2. If you are making a blog or other static site where you want to post your texts with a concise design.
3. You want to write beautiful messages in WhatsApp or Telegram.
4. You are a programmer and write documentation for your project on GitHub
5. Your own telegram secretary: we do it together

But in all these cases, you need one thing — to make a minimal layout of the text so that it looks neat and so that it can be read without special programs.
