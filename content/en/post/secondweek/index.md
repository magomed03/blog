## Introduction

Over the past week, I have completed laboratory work №5 and №6, the topics of which were "Linux file system Analysis" and "File Search. I/O redirection. View running processes".

## Laboratory work №5

The purpose of this laboratory was to familiarize with the Linux file system, its structure, names and contents of directories. Acquisition of practical skills in the use of commands for working with files and directories, process management (and work), checking disk usage and file system maintenance.

Tasks that I have completed:

1. Follow all the examples given in the theory.
2. Various manipulations with files and directories (copying, cutting, renaming, etc.).
3. Briefly describe mount, fsck, mkfs,

## Laboratory work №6

The purpose of this laboratory was to familiarize with the tools for searching files and filtering text data. Acquisition of practical skills: process management (and tasks), disk usage verification and file system maintenance.

Tasks that I have completed:

1. Study the find and grep commands and their application in practice.
2. Running programs in the background. 
3. Study the kill command and apply it to complete the process.
4. Using output-input redirection.

## Conclusion

As a result, I became more familiar with the Linux file system, its structure, names and contents of directories, and also acquired practical skills: managing processes (and tasks), checking disk usage and maintaining file systems.
