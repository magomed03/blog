## Introduction

Last week was a little different from the rest: I participated in the volleyball Spartakiad. Unfortunately, we lost, but it was still fun. If we talk about operating systems, then I did laboratory work No. 3 and No. 4, the topics of which were "Markdown" and "Fundamentals of the user interface with the Unix system at the command line level."

## Laboratory work №3

The purpose of this laboratory was to learn how to design reports using the lightweight Markdown markup language. It was necessary to redo the reports on the 2nd laboratory work in the Markdown format. For convenience, I used Visual studio code. This program allows you to preview the file even with small errors. This slightly simplifies the process of creating reports and presentations. 
During the work, I got acquainted with the basic information about Markdown, and then I redid the report on the 2nd laboratory work.

## Laboratory work №4

The purpose of this laboratory was to acquire practical skills of user interaction with the system via the command line. In the course of my work, I remembered the commands that I studied on the Architecture of computing systems, and I spent carefree times in the 1st module. tasks that I have completed:

1. Determine the full name of your home directory. Further, the following exercises will be performed with respect to this catalog.
2. Follow these steps:
    1. Go to the /tmp directory.
    2. Display the contents of the /tmp directory. To do this, use the ls command
    various options. Explain the difference in the information displayed on the screen.
    3. Determine if there is a subdirectory named cron in the /var/spool directory?
    4. Go to your home directory and display its contents. Determine who is the owner of the files and subdirectories?
3. Follow these steps:
    1. In the home directory, create a new directory named newdir.
    2. In the ~/newdir directory, create a new directory named morefun.
    3. In the home directory, create three new directories with the names with one command
    letters, memos, misk. Then delete these directories with one command.
    4. Try deleting the previously created directory ~/newdir with the rm command. Check it out,
    whether the directory was deleted.
    5. Delete the ~/newdir/morefun directory from the home directory. Check if
the directory has been deleted.
4. Use the man command to determine which option of the ls command should be used to view the contents of not only the specified directory, but also the subdirectories included in it.
5. Using the man command, define a set of options for the ls command that allows you to sort by the time of the last change the output list of directory contents
with an expanded description of files.
6. Use the man command to view the description of the following commands: cd, pwd, mkdir,
rmdir, rm. Explain the main options of these commands.
7. Using the information obtained using the history command, modify and execute several commands from the command buffer.

## Conclusion

As a result, I learned how to make reports and presentations in Markdown format, as well as interact with the system via the command line
