## Introduction

Over the past week, I have completed laboratory work №9 and №10, the topics of which were "emacs text editor" and "Programming in a UNIX command processor. Command files".

## Laboratory work №9

The purpose of this laboratory was to get acquainted with the Linux operating system. Get practical skills working with the Emacs editor.

Tasks that I have completed:

1. Created a file by calling emacs.
2. Performed various manipulations with the text in the file (copying, cutting, moving lines, etc.).
3. Played with the functionality of the editor.

## Laboratory work №10

The purpose of this laboratory was to study the basics of programming in the UNIX/Linux OS shell. Learn how to write small batch files.

Tasks that I have completed:

1. Write a script that, at startup, will make a backup copy of itself (that is, the file containing its source code) to another backup directory in your home directory. In this case, the file must be archived by one of the archivers to choose from zip, bzip2 or tar. You need to find out how to use archiving commands by studying the help.
2. Write an example of a command file that processes any arbitrary number of command-line arguments, including more than ten. For example, a script can print out the values of all passed arguments sequentially.
3. Write a command file analogous to the ls command (without using this command itself and the dir command). It is required that it provides information about the desired directory and displays information about the possibilities of accessing files in this directory.
4. Write a command file that receives as a command-line argument the file format (.txt, .doc, .jpg, .pdf, etc.) and calculates the number of such files in the specified directory. The path to the directory is also passed as a command line argument.

## Conclusion

As a result, I got acquainted with the emacs text editor, and also learned how to write simple command files.
