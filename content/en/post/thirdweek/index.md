## Introduction

Over the past week, I have completed lab work №7 and №8, the topics of which were "Midnight Commander Command Shell" and "vi Text Editor".

## Laboratory work №7

The purpose of this laboratory was to master the basic capabilities of the Midnight Commander command shell. Acquisition of practical skills in viewing directories and files; manipulations
with them.

Tasks that I have completed:

1. Studied and played with the MC menu.
2. Performed various actions with files in the built-in MC editor.

## Laboratory work №6

The purpose of this laboratory was to familiarize with the tools for searching files and filtering text data. Acquisition of practical skills: process management (and tasks), disk usage verification and file system maintenance.

Tasks that I have completed:

1. Studied the main features of the vi editor.
2. Performed various actions with the text in the editor.

## Conclusion

As a result, I got to know Midnight Commander better, the editor built into it, as well as the vi editor.
